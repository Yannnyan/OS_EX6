# Overview
In this project we've implemented some basic design patterns such as singleton, reactor, active object and guard, in order to solve client server pattern style.

# How to run

1. Open two or more terminals and path to the folder.
2. type "make all"
3. run your desired server on one terminal (Server for active object server, selectServer for Reactor based server)
4. run on your second third forth and so on the desired client (Client for the active object server, and selectClient for the reactor's client).
5. enter words and enjoy

make tragets:
``` make all ``` - this makes all the targets to run the active object client server and the reactor client server.
